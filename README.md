This is a repository for a Soccer Coordinator application, which is the first project for treehouse techdegree written in swift.

Let it be noted there is no interface for this application and all the logic are implemented in Contents.swift in playground.

This repository meant to be for educational purposes and peer reviews at treehouse.

Cheers,
